# PyPong

A slightly simplified version of classic game Pong, originally made as a mini-project on [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1). That course uses the online tool CodeSkulptor, which has a GUI module specific for its didactic purposes, so the version in this repository has been adapted to use Tkinter instead. The CodeSkulptor version can be found [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_ZPXlaPPprxRhHp1.py).

Other than some minor visual changes, the only difference is that the version here has the player going against the machine, while on CodeSkulptor the player controls both paddles (the left one with W/S and the right one with the arrow keys).
